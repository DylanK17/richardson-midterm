    <p>This is for the Midterm Dev. Portfolio Project. I have really enjoyed this class so far, and I have learned so many new things. Dr. Cumbie does an excellent job of showing us new ways to write HTML and CSS in order make sure our code is neat and professional.

    <p>This is just random text to fill in the text area. I only have 18 hours left in my degree after this semester and I will be able to graduate! I am really excited to be able to get my degree and come out into the real world. I actually already have
      a great job at a security company.</p>
    <p> I work for Danmark Communications and Security located in Rogersville, Alabama. It is a very good place to work. All my co-workers are very kind and we are work together to make our customers happy. The owner is Daniel Clemmons, and he is the greatest
      boss I have ever seen. He always make sure we are all taken care of and he does not hesitate to buy us breakfast or lunch, and he even buys us gifts quite frequently to show us that he appreciates our hard work. I plan to make this my career and
      continue working here for years to come.</p>
